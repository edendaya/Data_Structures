# Data_Structures
Implementation of an AVL Tree in Python, developed as part of my studies at TAU University during my 3rd semester.

The AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of each node is at most one. This structure allows for efficient operations (lookup, insertion, deletion) with a time complexity of O(log n), regardless of the tree size. Insertions and deletions may trigger tree rotations to maintain balance.
