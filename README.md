Implementation of avl tree in python, TAU University, 3th semester

I developed an AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, meeting the criteria where each node's subtrees have a maximum height difference of one.
This structure enables efficient operations (lookup, insertion, deletion) in O(log n) time, regardless of the tree's size.
Insertions and deletions may trigger rebalancing using tree rotations.
